# Puzriš-Dagan (Drehem) Transaction Types

Each edge in our network (a connection between two persons) is found in a document. We can characterize each document by document **type** and use these types as edge attributes. The documents arew distinguished from the point of view of the central administration: commodities coming in (deliveries); commodities going out (expenditures); commodities transferred from one office to another (transfers); balanced accounts, and inventories.

## Deliveries

Deliveries are characterized by the keyword **mu-DU** (delivery). The word mu-DU may be followed by a qualification, such as mu-DU lugal (delivery for the king) or mu-kux(DU) {d}szul-gi-si2-im-tum (delivery for [queen] Šulgi-simtum). Often (but not always) the **mu-DU** is followed by the expression **PN i₃-dab₅** (PN took it).

## Expenditures

Expenditures are characterized by the keyword **zi** (to expend) either in the form **PN ba-zi** (PN expended it) or in the form **zi-ga PN** (expenditure of PN). You may also find **zi-ga lugal** (expenditures of the king).

## Transfers

Transfers are characterized by the keyword **dab₅** always in the form **i₃-dab₅**. This same expression is also found in many delivery text, but there it is preceded by **mu-DU**. In transfers the pattern is: 
ki PN-ta      from Mr. X
PN-e i₃-dab₅  Mr. Y took it

## Transfers of dead animals

The specific key word for the transfer of dead animals is **šu ba-ti** (he received).

## Balanced account

Balanced accounts are characterized by **nig₂-ka₉-ak**. This is an account of how many animals a shepherd originally received and how many he still has left.
